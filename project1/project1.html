                Hello, and welcome to Keegan's Room!! I'm Keegan, and this is my room. I'm a ten year old boy and this site has all my favorite things. I really like trucks, rock stars, football, and ice cream cake, but we will get on to that later. I made this site because I was tired of my mom telling me to clean my room and I figured it would be easier to make a room that cleans itself. NO GROWN UPS ALLOWED!!!

                    This week's blog: Aren't trucks just super cool?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Man, this week I was just inspired, for the 16th week in a row, to write about how cool trucks are. I know that some people (meanies) may say that only writing about trucks for 16 weeks is "boring" and "a waste of time and server space" but seriously, trucks are what I, a ten year old boy, live for. From their wheels to how big they are, trucks are just super cool. Not to mention how many different trucks there are. Dumpster trucks (also known by many as garbage trucks), pickup trucks,
                    fire trucks, monster trucks, ice cream trucks, and countless other trucks, all of which are super important to the truck community. To other truck enthusiasts, please don't be upset if I left out one of your favorite trucks, or even your second or third favorite. There are so many trucks and different uses for trucks that honestly it is hard to keep track.

                I hope you found this blog as stimulating and well written as I did, and I hope to see you back next week for another installment in Keegan's Super Fun Blog Time!

                This week's experiment: How Trucks Work
            </h4>
            <p>
               Hey guys!! I just read a super cool article about how trucks work and decided it would be super rad to share it with you all on my site. As we all know, trucks and how they run are a mystery of science, and ten year olds like myself have been trying to figure it out since our diaper days. I've been hitting the books pretty hard, but I think I've finally found the answer to how trucks are run, and it's attached below. Please feel free to take notes or color a picture about how the article makes you feel. It's very important to learn and understand all we can about trucks because they are so totally rad.

                        Speaking of recess, this is my dream playground! I can only imagine playing on this for the 45 minutes allowed to me each day for actual fun. Wouldn't it be super cool to use it as a fort, or play tag here?
